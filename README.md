Austin, TX Buildings and addresses import project
=================================================

This repo is a central place to organize/document our project to import the
building footprint and address point datasets from the City of Austin into
OpenStreetMap.

All levels of OSM / geo experience are welcome. There's plenty of stuff to do
and we'll have time to learn whatever we need to along the way, so please join
us.
